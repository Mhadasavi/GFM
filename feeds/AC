1. Get Metadata from files and store in csv file.
    Done

2. Implement elapsed time and input of directory from user.
    Done

3. Adding New Path removes the old content from the csv file. Update the logic to keep the old content also.
    keep historical data and do incremental updates:
        * Create a master CSV (e.g., file_metadata_master.csv)
        * During each run, create a new metadata CSV (e.g., file_metadata_2025_05_25.csv)
        * Use a script to merge the new one into the master, avoiding duplicates.
        * Merging strategy:
            - Consider (file_path + modified_date) as the unique key to deduplicate entries.
            - Or hash the file_path + size_bytes + modified_date as a dedup key.

Optional
1. Implement meta_row_id, log start and end time as elapsed time is not accurate.
2. Use Sql Db to dump all csvs into tables.
